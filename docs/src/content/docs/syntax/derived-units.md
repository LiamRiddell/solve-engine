description: Multiplying quantities into a named physical unit like the newton, watt or joule.

Many physical quantities are really other quantities multiplied together. A
**force** is a mass times an acceleration; **power** is voltage times current;
**energy** is power times time, or a force times a distance. When you multiply
two quantities, the engine tracks what their units combine into, and when the
result is one of these named quantities, it shows it by its name:

```solve
70 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 as N // 686.70 N
230 V * 13 A as W // 2,990.00 W
50 N * 4 m as J // 200.00 J
2000 W * 3 hours as kWh // 6.00 kWh
```

`N` is the newton (force), `W` the watt (power), `J` the joule (energy), and
`kWh` the kilowatt-hour (energy again, the unit an electricity bill uses).
Writing `as N` asks for the answer in that unit; the engine also names the result
on its own when you leave the `as` off. Dividing names a result the same way: an
energy over a time is a power, and a force over an area is a **pressure**, in
pascals (`Pa`).

```solve
100 J / 5 s // 20.00 W
200 N / 2 m² // 100.00 Pa
100 Pa * 2 m² // 200.00 N
```

Every spelling of a quantity takes part, imperial as well as metric, so pounds,
feet and pound-force (`lbf`) compose just as kilograms, metres and newtons do.

```solve
10 lbf * 3 ft // 40.67 J
5 lb * 9.8 m/s^2 // 22.23 N
```

An acceleration is written in metres per second squared, `m/s^2` or `m/s²`, and
that is the one acceleration unit the engine holds. It converts to itself, and
anything else asked of it is refused in words: an acceleration is not a force
until a mass multiplies it.

```solve-doc
9.81 m/s² in m/s^2 // 9.81 m/s²
9.81 m/s^2 in N // ERROR: an acceleration cannot be converted to a force
```

A power used for a time of a minute or more is named in watt-hours, with the
power's own prefix: a 2 kW heater for three hours uses 6 kilowatt-hours, the
figure a bill charges for, rather than 21,600,000 joules. Dividing such an energy
by a time gives the power back in the matching watt. A power for seconds stays in
joules, the energy's own scale.

```solve
2 kW * 3 h // 6.00 kWh
100 W * 3 hours // 300.00 Wh
6 kWh / 3 h // 2.00 kW
100 W * 30 s // 3,000.00 J
```

This works only where the combination makes a named quantity, and multiplying
two unrelated quantities is still reported as a mismatch rather than invented
into a unit. Lengths are the exception that needs no name: a length times a
length is an area and a length times an area is a volume, so `5 m * 3 m` is
`15.00 m²`. Those rules, and rates that cancel against what they are per, are on
[multiplying and dividing units](/syntax/unit-algebra/).

The boundary: the named units are the newton, joule, watt, pascal and volt. A
combination with no name among them, such as a kilogram-metre, is not shown as a
compound unit.
