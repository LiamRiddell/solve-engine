Comma separates columns, semicolon separates rows.

```solve
[1,2,3] // [1, 2, 3]
[1,2;3,4] // [1, 2; 3, 4]
```

## Element-wise arithmetic

```solve
[1,2,3] * 10 // [10, 20, 30]
[1,2,3] + [10,20,30] // [11, 22, 33]
```

## Matrix products

Multiplying two matrices whose shapes line up performs a real matrix product
rather than an element-wise one.

```solve
[1, 2; 3, 4] * [1; 2] // [5; 11]
```

## Indexing

Indices are zero-based.

```solve
[1,2,3][0] // 1
[1,2;3,4][1,1] // 4
```

## Linear algebra

```solve
[1,2;3,4]^T // [1, 3; 2, 4]
det([1,2;3,4]) // -2
[1,2;3,4]^-1 // [-2.00, 1.00; 1.50, -0.50]
```

The inverse operator leaves ordinary numbers alone, so `5^-1` is still `0.2`.
